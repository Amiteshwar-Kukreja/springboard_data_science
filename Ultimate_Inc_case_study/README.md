# Ultimate Inc Take Home Challenge

Ultimate Inc is a ride-hailing company that wants to understand its customers and drivers better. It has a lot of data captured on customers and drivers behavior and would like this to be leveraged to gather insights on drivers & customers, perform experiments and predict future behavior.


This repo contains my work on 
1) Analysing user logins to uncover daily patterns
2) Devising an experiment to encourage driver partners to serve the twin cities of Gotham and Metropolis 
3) Creating a predictive model for user retention and uncovering insights for improving customer retention in future.
